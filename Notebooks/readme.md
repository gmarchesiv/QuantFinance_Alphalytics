# Analysis

Using the Leading Economic Index produced by the Conference Board, I identify patterns in monthly, quarterly and semi-annual changes in the index, as well as in the magnitude of the semi-annual changes, to classify each month into one of the four stages of the economic cycle. I contrast this classification with NBER's determination of contraction and expansion periods. I use this backdrop to estimate the average returns of each asset during each stage and estimate the correlations among assets to choose a shifting optimized portafolio across stages.   

## List of notebooks
1. Stages_business_cycles: calculates 1m, 3m and 6m changes in the LEI and the signs of those changes to determine the four stages of the economic cycle.
